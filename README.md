# Hapara Cache Exercise - Felipe Falco

Small Cache Exercise done for Hapara "Junior Developer" job application.

If you are just interested in analyzing the class of LRUCache created for the exercise, go to the file "LRUCache.cs" on the root folder.

Note: Debug lines (Console.WriteLine) have been left on both C# files for clarification. I would, of course, remove them on deployment, 
however since it's an exercise I thought it would make things easier to discuss on our phone call.
